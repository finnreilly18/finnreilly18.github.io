<h1>Finn Reilly's Personal Website</h1> <h2>About Me</h2> Hello, my name is Finn Reilly and I am a sophmore here at Redwood.
I love to play sports, workout, spend time with my friends in family, and listen to music. 
<h3>Sports</h3> Ever since I was a little kid I have loved to play sports, my first word was even ball.
Orginally as a kid my dad introduced me to most sports either by teaching me or watching it on the tv.
 As a kid I played numerous sports such as soccer, basketball, football, and baseball. 
 Although, as I got older I dropped soccer and basketball and picked up track aswell as rugby for one year.
Now heading into sophmore year I play just football and track.
<h3>Working out</h3>
