<h1>Finn Reilly's Personal Website</h1> <h2>About Me</h2> Hello, my name is <e>Finn Reilly</e> and I am a sophmore here at Redwood.
I love to play sports, workout, spend time with my friends in family, listen to music and play video games.
<h3>Sports</h3> 
<p>Ever since I was a little kid I have loved to play sports, my first word was even ball.
Orginally as a kid my dad introduced me to most sports either by teaching me or watching it on the tv.
 As a kid I played numerous sports such as soccer, basketball, football, and baseball. 
 Although, as I got older I dropped soccer and basketball and picked up track aswell as rugby for one year.
Now heading into sophmore year I play just football and track.</p>
<h3>Working out</h3> 
<p>I started working out during the pandemic because of how bored I was.
Although I didnt do much it was better than nothing I mostly just did pushups and simple exerises like that.
As I got older I began lifting weights and working out has became part of my routine.</p>
<h3>Friends and Family</h3> 
<p>My <e>family</e> has always been someone I can rely on and I couldnt imagine where I would be without them.
My parants and my sister are my closest relatives, but everyone else in my family has been great too.
I spend almost every day with at least on of my friends and it helps me feel happy. 
We always try to hang out and have sleepovers.</p>
