     <h1>Bird watching photos</h1>
    <h3><span class="fish">The Flying Fish</span></h3>
    <p> I took this photo in our voyage through the carribean.</p>

    <h3><span class="pigeon">The Pigeon</span></h3>
    <p>This is Doms favorite photo he took. He brags about it and posts it everywhere he loves this bird with a passion.</p>
    <img src="media/download.jpg" alt="pigeon">
    <h3><span class="ostritch">The Ostritch</span></h3>
    <p>This bird means more to me and Dom than life itself. Dom even owns a pet ostritch</p>
    <P>This is a photo of Dom's pet ostritch his name is Josh Norman, but he goes by larry. </P>
    <p>This is when Dom tried to ride him around town, but larry ran off on his own.</p>

    <h3><span class="thechicken"> The Chicken</span></h3>
    <p>Many people think the Chicken can not fly, but that is false. The Chicken can fly and we have proof</p>
    <p>This is our pet Chicken, Luke Mueller he wears backward hats and wired headphones</p>
    <p>As we see in the photo he can fly proving he is a Bird</p>

    <h3><span class="demon">The Flying Squirrel</span></h3>
    <p>Many people say this bird is a myth and they trully are wrong, we even have our own pet Squirrel</p>
    <p>He goes by the name of justin son he can fly and we love taking photos of him</p>
    <p>This photo we had to travel thousands of miles just to take this at the right time, it was sick. </p>
    <img src="media/cashew.webp" alt="Squirell" width="300">
    <h3><span class="racoon">The Flying Racoon</span></h3>
    <p>This bird may be the coolest bird me and dom ever caught on camera. To be honest I thought it was fake</p>
    <p>All I can say is ask Luke Mueller.</p>
    <p>He goes by the name of Gease the great and he lives in our backyard with some of the other birds</p>
    <img src="media/joshua normasito.jpg" alt= "The Bird" width="300">
    <h3><span class="theflyingdolphin">The Flying Dolphin</span></h3>
    <p>This bird is very beautifull. He is a flying dolphin</p>
    <p>He is the only one in the world we found him exploring in the amazon river where we tamed him with some fish</p>
    <p>This bird now lives with us now in our pool and his name is Fitz Nawitzki</p>
    <img src="media/fitz.jpg" alt="The Swimming Bird" width="300">
    <h3><span class="theclam">The Flying Clam</span></h3>
    <p>The Clam, the Clam, the Clam. This bird isn't as rare as the others, but still very cool</p>
    <p>Throughout or journey through Nebraska, Dom saw one flying and had to capitlize.</p>
    <p>He caught it in the act flying, quickly caught it and tamed it</p>
    <p>It lives in our pool with the Flying Fish and Flying Dolphin, Dom named it Sally the third</p>
